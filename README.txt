KNOWN ISSUES:
- multiple flags doesnt work sometimes?: not sure tho
- the -d flag doesnt work ?
- the main have coding style issue
- the -a flag doesnt sort the thing alphabetically
- used qsort() instead of custom made lexicographical sorting function
- even the qsort() doesnt do it in th els order NEED A CUSTOME SORTING FUNCTION


TODO:
- implement the -t sort by modif dates
- implement the -R recursive display subdirectories
- implement the -l use a long display format
- in the a_flag.c eventually have the 50 be remplaced by somethign else like the actual number en entries
- some other place needs the thing above i dont remember where, ENTRIES_COUNT

DONE:
- implement the my_ls_basic (without any flags)
- implement the -a display all even hidden files (currently its not alphabetically correct)
- implement the -d display only directories
- implement the -r display with reverse order
